### I am currently working on **Daily Hat Trick**, my full stack NHL stats tracking app. 
- [Front End](https://github.com/tdimp/daily-hat-trick-front)
- [Back End](https://github.com/tdimp/daily-hat-trick-back)

I hope to complete some minor refactors, add a few more features, and then deploy it for hockey enthusiasts worldwide!

Check out my pinned projects below for more examples of my work!

## Addenda

When I am not writing code, I am likely diving into a book, walking my dog, or riding my bike around town.
